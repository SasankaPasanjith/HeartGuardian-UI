# HeartGuardian Heart Disease Prediction  System

This front end was created using React & Vite for the HeartGuardian Heart Disease Prediction  System.

This website provides a prediction system that can help individuals determine if they or their loved ones are at risk for heart disease from home. The system uses only body indicators that are easy to measure. Additionally, the website offers comprehensive information about heart disease to help users gain a better understanding of the condition.
